class OutputStream(StreamBase):
    """
    Basic BulkIO output stream class.

    OutputStream encapsulates a single BulkIO stream for writing. It is
    associated with the output port that created it, providing a file-like API
    on top of the classic BulkIO pushPacket model.

    Notionally, a BulkIO stream represents a contiguous data set and its
    associated signal-related information (SRI), uniquely identified by a
    stream ID, from creation until close. The SRI may vary over time, but the
    stream ID is immutable. Only one stream with a given stream ID can be
    active at a time.

    OutputStreams help manage the stream lifetime by tying that SRI with an
    output port and ensuring that all data is associated with a valid stream.
    When the stream is complete, it may be closed, notifying downstream
    receivers that no more data is expected.

    OutputStreams must be created via an output port. A stream cannot be
    associated with more than one port.

    SRI Changes:
    Updates to the stream that modify or replace its SRI are cached locally
    until the next write to minimize the number of updates that are published.
    When there are pending SRI changes, the OutputStream pushes the updated SRI
    first, followed by the data.

class BufferedOutputStream(OutputStream):
    """
    BulkIO output stream class with data buffering.

    BufferedOutputStream can use an internal buffer to queue up multiple
    packets worth of data into a single push. By default, buffering is
    disabled.

    Data Buffering:
    BufferedOutputStreams can combine multiple small chunks of data into a
    single packet for reduced I/O overhead. Data buffering is enabled by
    setting a non-zero buffer size via the setBufferSize() method. The output
    stream creates an internal buffer of the requested size; the stream's
    complex mode is not taken into account.

    With buffering enabled, each write copies its data into the internal
    buffer, up to the maximum of the buffer size. When the internal buffer is
    full, a packet is sent via the output port, using the time stamp of the
    first buffered sample. After the packet is sent, the internal buffer is
    reset to its initial state. If there is any remaining data from the write,
    it is copied into a new buffer and a new starting time stamp is
    interpolated.

    Time Stamps:
    When buffering is enabled, the time stamps provided to the write() methods
    may be discarded. Furthermore, when write sizes do not align exactly with
    the buffer size, the output time stamp may be interpolated. If precise
    time stamps are required, buffering should not be used.
