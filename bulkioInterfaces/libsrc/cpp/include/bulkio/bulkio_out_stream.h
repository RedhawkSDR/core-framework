     * @brief  Abstract BulkIO output stream class.
     * @headerfile  bulkio_out_stream.h <bulkio/bulkio_out_stream.h>
     *
     * %OutputStream is a smart pointer-based class that encapsulates a single
     * BulkIO stream for writing. It is associated with the output port that
     * created it, providing a file-like API on top of the classic BulkIO
     * pushPacket model.
     *
     * @warning  Do not declare instances of this template class directly in
     *           user code; the template parameter and class name are not
     *           considered API. Use the type-specific @c typedef instead, such
     *           as bulkio::OutFloatStream, or the nested @c typedef StreamType
     *           from an %OutPort.
     *
     * Notionally, a BulkIO stream represents a contiguous data set and its
     * associated signal-related information (SRI), uniquely identified by a
     * stream ID, from creation until close. The SRI may vary over time, but
     * the stream ID is immutable. Only one stream with a given stream ID can
     * be active at a time.
     *
     * OutputStreams help manage the stream lifetime by tying that SRI with an
     * output port and ensuring that all data is associated with a valid stream.
     * When the stream is complete, it may be closed, notifying downstream
     * receivers that no more data is expected.
     *
     * The %OutputStream class itself is a lightweight handle; it is inexpensive
     * to copy or store in local variables or nested data types. Assigning one
     * %OutputStream to another does not copy the stream state, but instead, it
     * aliases both objects to the same underlying stream.
     *
     * The default constructor creates an invalid "null" %OutputStream that cannot
     * be used for any real operations, similar to a null pointer. A stream may
     * be checked for validity with boolean tests:
     *
     * @code
     * if (!stream) {
     *     // handle failure
     * }
     * @endcode
     * or
     * @code
     * if (stream) {
     *     // operate on stream
     * }
     * @endcode
     *
     * OutputStreams must be created via an %OutPort. A stream cannot be
     * associated with more than one port.
     * @see  OutPort::createStream(const std::string&)
     * @see  OutPort::createStream(const BULKIO::StreamSRI&)
     *
     * @par  SRI Changes
     * Updates to the stream that modify its SRI are cached locally until the
     * next write to minimize the number of updates that are published. When
     * there are pending SRI changes, the %OutputStream pushes the updated SRI
     * first, followed by the data.
