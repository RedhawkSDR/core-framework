        a custom port implementation you can override the specific implementation here with a statement

        Basic functionality:
        
            The process method should process a single "chunk" of data and then return. This method
            will be called from the processing thread again, and again, and again until it returns
            FINISH or stop() is called on the device.  If no work is performed, then return NOOP.
            
        StreamSRI:
            To create a StreamSRI object, use the following code (this generates a normalized SRI that does not flush the queue when full):
                self.sri = bulkio.sri.create(self.stream_id)

        PrecisionUTCTime:
            To create a PrecisionUTCTime object, use the following code:
                tstamp = bulkio.timestamp.now() 
  
        Ports:

            Each port instance is accessed through members of the following form: self.port_<PORT NAME>
            
            Data is obtained in the process function through the getPacket call (BULKIO only) on a
            provides port member instance. The getPacket function call is non-blocking - if no data
            is available, it will return immediately with all values == None.
            
            To send data, call the appropriate function in the port directly. In the case of BULKIO,
            convenience functions have been added in the port classes that aid in output.
            
            Interactions with non-BULKIO ports are left up to the device developer's discretion.
            
        Properties:
        
            Properties are accessed directly as member variables. If the property name is baudRate,
            then accessing it (for reading or writing) is achieved in the following way: self.baudRate.

            To implement a change callback notification for a property, create a callback function with the following form:

            def mycallback(self, id, old_value, new_value):
                pass

            where id is the property id, old_value is the previous value, and new_value is the updated value.
            
            The callback is then registered on the component as:
            self.addPropertyChangeListener('baudRate', self.mycallback)
            
        Allocation:
            
            Allocation callbacks are available to customize a Device's response to an allocation request. Callbacks
            are found automatically by the base class through a naming convention. The naming convention used
            is to prepend "allocate_" to the allocation property's name. For example, if the Device contains an
            allocation property called "my_alloc", the allocation callback is defined as:
            
            def allocate_my_alloc(self, value):
                # perform logic
                return True # successful allocation
            
        Example:
        
            # This example assumes that the device has two ports:
            #   - A provides (input) port of type bulkio.InShortPort called dataShort_in
            #   - A uses (output) port of type bulkio.OutFloatPort called dataFloat_out
            # The mapping between the port and the class if found in the device
            # base class.
            # This example also makes use of the following Properties:
            #   - A float value called amplitude
            #   - A boolean called increaseAmplitude
            
            data, T, EOS, streamID, sri, sriChanged, inputQueueFlushed = self.port_dataShort_in.getPacket()
            
            if data == None:
                return NOOP
                
            outData = range(len(data))
            for i in range(len(data)):
                if self.increaseAmplitude:
                    outData[i] = float(data[i]) * self.amplitude
                else:
                    outData[i] = float(data[i])
                
            # NOTE: You must make at least one valid pushSRI call
            if sriChanged:
                self.port_dataFloat_out.pushSRI(sri);

            self.port_dataFloat_out.pushPacket(outData, T, EOS, streamID)
