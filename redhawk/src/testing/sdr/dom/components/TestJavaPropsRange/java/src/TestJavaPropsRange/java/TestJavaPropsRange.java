     * This is the component constructor. In this method, you may add additional
     * functionality to properties, such as listening for changes and handling
     * allocation, and set up internal state for your component.
     *
     * A component may listen for external changes to properties (i.e., by a
     * call to configure) using the PropertyListener interface. Listeners are
     * registered by calling addChangeListener() on the property instance
     * with an object that implements the PropertyListener interface for that
     * data type (e.g., "PropertyListener<Float>" for a float property). More
     * than one listener can be connected to a property.
     *
     *   Example:
     *       // This example makes use of the following properties:
     *       //  - A float value called scaleValue
     *       // The file must import "org.ossie.properties.PropertyListener"
     *       // Add the following import to the top of the file:
     *       import org.ossie.properties.PropertyListener;
     *
     *       //Add the following to the class constructor:
     *       this.scaleValue.addChangeListener(new PropertyListener<Float>() {
     *           public void valueChanged(Float oldValue, Float newValue) {
     *               scaleValueChanged(oldValue, newValue);
     *           }
     *       });
     *
     *       //Add the following method to the class:
     *       private void scaleValueChanged(Float oldValue, Float newValue)
     *       {
     *          logger.debug("Changed scaleValue " + oldValue + " to " + newValue);
     *       }
     *
     * The recommended practice is for the implementation of valueChanged() to
     * contain only glue code to dispatch the call to a private method on the
     * component class.

    /**
     *
     * Main processing function
     *
     * General functionality:
     *
     * The serviceFunction() is called repeatedly by the component's processing
     * thread, which runs independently of the main thread. Each invocation
     * should perform a single unit of work, such as reading and processing one
     * data packet.
     *
     * The return status of serviceFunction() determines how soon the next
     * invocation occurs:
     *   - NORMAL: the next call happens immediately
     *   - NOOP:   the next call happens after a pre-defined delay (100 ms)
     *   - FINISH: no more calls occur
     *
     * StreamSRI:
     *    To create a StreamSRI object, use the following code:
     *            String stream_id = "testStream";
     *            BULKIO.StreamSRI sri = new BULKIO.StreamSRI();
     *            sri.mode = 0;
     *            sri.xdelta = 0.0;
     *            sri.ydelta = 1.0;
     *            sri.subsize = 0;
     *            sri.xunits = 1; // TIME_S
     *            sri.streamID = (stream_id != null) ? stream_id : "";
     *
     * PrecisionUTCTime:
     *    To create a PrecisionUTCTime object, use the following code:
     *            BULKIO.PrecisionUTCTime tstamp = bulkio.time.utils.now();
     *
     * Ports:
     *
     *    Each port instance is accessed through members of the following form:
     *
     *        this.port_<PORT NAME>
     *
     *    Input BULKIO data is obtained by calling getPacket on the provides
     *    port. The getPacket method takes one argument: the time to wait for
     *    data to arrive, in milliseconds. A timeout of 0 causes getPacket to
     *    return immediately, while a negative timeout indicates an indefinite
     *    wait. If no data is queued and no packet arrives during the waiting
     *    period, getPacket returns null.
     *
     *    Output BULKIO data is sent by calling pushPacket on the uses port. In
     *    the case of numeric data, the pushPacket method takes a primitive
     *    array (e.g., "float[]"), a timestamp, an end-of-stream flag and a
     *    stream ID. You must make at least one call to pushSRI to associate a
     *    StreamSRI with the stream ID before calling pushPacket, or receivers
     *    may drop the data.
     *
     *    When all processing on a stream is complete, a call should be made to
     *    pushPacket with the end-of-stream flag set to "true".
     *
     *    Interactions with non-BULKIO ports are left up to the discretion of
     *    the component developer.
     *
     * Properties:
     *
     *    Properties are accessed through members of the same name; characters
     *    that are invalid for a Java identifier are replaced with "_". The
     *    current value of the property is read with getValue and written with
     *    setValue:
     *
     *        float val = this.float_prop.getValue();
     *        ...
     *        this.float_prop.setValue(1.5f);
     *
     *    Primitive data types are stored using the corresponding Java object
     *    wrapper class. For example, a property of type "float" is stored as a
     *    Float. Java will automatically box and unbox primitive types where
     *    appropriate.
     *
     *    Numeric properties support assignment via setValue from any numeric
     *    type. The standard Java type coercion rules apply (e.g., truncation
     *    of floating point values when converting to integer types).
     *
     * Example:
     *
     *    This example assumes that the component has two ports:
     *        - A bulkio.InShortPort provides (input) port called dataShort_in
     *        - A bulkio.OutFloatPort uses (output) port called dataFloat_out
     *    The mapping between the port and the class is found in the component
     *    base class file.
     *    This example also makes use of the following Properties:
     *        - A float value called amplitude with a default value of 2.0
     *        - A boolean called increaseAmplitude with a default value of true
     *
     *    bulkio.InShortPort.Packet data = this.port_dataShort_in.getPacket(125);
     *
     *    if (data != null) {
     *        float[] outData = new float[data.getData().length];
     *        for (int i = 0; i < data.getData().length; i++) {
     *            if (this.increaseAmplitude.getValue()) {
     *                outData[i] = (float)data.getData()[i] * this.amplitude.getValue();
     *            } else {
     *                outData[i] = (float)data.getData()[i];
     *            }
     *        }
     *
     *        // NOTE: You must make at least one valid pushSRI call
     *        if (data.sriChanged()) {
     *            this.port_dataFloat_out.pushSRI(data.getSRI());
     *        }
     *        this.port_dataFloat_out.pushPacket(outData, data.getTime(), data.getEndOfStream(), data.getStreamID());
     *    }
