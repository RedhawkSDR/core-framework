/*
 * Prior to 1.8, the code generators did not define an operator== for struct
 * properties; although most user code should be 1.8.0 or newer, some of the
 * unit test components predate that change. For compatibility, the equals
 * function can be templatized to use == if it is available, but falls back on
 * something else (memcmp).
 *
 * Note that the types and methods for performing the boost::enable_if tests
 * are only declared, and never actually defined or instantiated. Everything is
 * hidden in an internal namespace to prevent polluting the global namespace
 * and introducing potential ambiguities in functions overloads.
