"""
Python interface to the X-Midas BLUE file format.  Uses the xmpyapi
module for X-Midas read/write AUXILIARY paths if available.  Supports
header and data in IEEE big and little endian formats only.

Main header keywords are imported as a dictionary. Extended header
keywords are imported as a list of (key, value) tuples.

ASCII data is imported in chunks corresponding to the format code
given (e.g. XA would be 80 character chunks) and by default, is
returned with trailing nulls and spaces removed.  The user can
optionally turn off the removal of trailing null characters by
setting bluefile's retain_nulls variable to True.
For example,

  import bluefile
  bluefile.retain_nulls = True

will turn off ALL stripping of null characters for the current session,
or until the variable is set back to False.

When ASCII data is exported it is space padded to the end of the atom.
Supports bit data only if it is accessed on byte boundaries and returns
it as a single string for type 1000, or a list of strings for type 2000
files.  Type 3000/5000 data is imported as a list of dictionaries.  Type
4000 data is imported as a list of records, each record being a list of
(key, value) tuples, the same format as the extended header keywords.

All multi-element numeric data is returned as a NumPy array.
Complex double and float data (CD and CF) are supported directly by
the numpy module; complex integer data and all other groupings with
more than 2 scalars per atom are returned as a multi-dimensional
NumPy array.

Type 2000 numeric data is typically returned as a list of NumPy
arrays; however, for users that prefer a 2-dimensional array, it is
possible to override this behavior.  Refer to the help for the method
set_type2000_format() for more detail.

Extended long integers (64-bits, data type 'X'), introduced in X-Midas
4.3.0, are supported for both keywords and data. Type 1000/2000 data is
handled as a NumPy array of type numpy.int64, while keywords, subrecords
and components are returned as Python longs.

Typical usage:

    import bluefile

    header, data = bluefile.read('file1')
    # change header and/or data
    bluefile.write('file2', hdr, data)

    Adding subrecords or components to a new type 3000/5000 file
    requires multiple fields to be calculated in concert.  Use the

    Returns a dictionary [, file object tuple].

    Returns the main header for BLUE files as a Python dictionary.

    <filename> can be either be the name of a file on disk, or
    an open, file-like object with the file pointer positioned at
    the beginning of a bluefile header.  If a file-like object,
    <keepopen> should be set to True; in which case, the given
    <filename> is simply returned back to the caller as the file
    object, and closure of the in-memory object is avoided.
    
    If <keepopen> (default 0) is true, a file object wrapping the
    open BLUE file is also returned.

    If <ext_header_type> (default None, or list for type 6000 files)
    is the type object str, list, dict, bluefile.XMKVList or
    bluefile.XMTable, the extended header keywords section is read in
    and assigned to the 'ext_header' field in the Python dictionary
    returned.  If type is str, the extended header is kept in its
    binary packed format and is returned as a raw string. This string
    can later be unpacked to a list of (key, value) pairs by
    unpack_ext_header(), or can be written directly back to disk
    unaltered.  If the type given is list, return the keywords
    unpacked as a list of (key, value) pairs, the native format for
    X-Midas keywords.  A type of dict takes this list and constructs a
    Python dictionary with the dict() method before returning it (see
    the discussion of precedence of repeated keys below).  The
    bluefile.XMKVList and bluefile.XMTable types are similar to list
    and dict but also interpret any structure tags found in the
    X-Midas keywords that indicate nested dictionaries and lists.
    These tags are embedded in the X-Midas keywords by calling
    writeheader() or write() with bluefile.XMKVList or
    bluefile.XMTable and preserve the structure of any Python
    dictionaries and lists found in the extended header.  See the
    discussion of structured vs unstructured keywords in the doc
    string for pack_keywords() for more details.

    Since subrecord information for type 6000 files is stored in the
    extended header and is required to interpret the data section of
    the file, the extended header is always opened for type 6000
    files.  <ext_header_type> can still be specified but defaults to
    list if not specified.

    Repeated Key Precedende in the Extended Header: The most correct
    Python representation of X-Midas extended header keywords is a
    list of (key, value) pairs, although they are frequently treated
    as dictionaries.  X-Midas has limited capability for embedding
    structure to its keywords by repeating key names in a convention
    called ''keyword scoping''. Scoped sections are the keywords found
    between two repeated key names.  When specifying dict or
    bluefile.XMTable as the preferred <ext_header_type>, readheader()
    unpacks the keywords to the native (key, value) pair list, then
    calls the Python dict() method on this top level list to produce
    the Python dictionary requested.  In dict(), if any key names are
    repeated in the list, the value of the LAST repeated key will
    replace the value of any previous keys.  In X-Midas if you perform
    a KEYWORD GET on a key name that is repeated, the value of the
    FIRST repeated key is returned.  For the KEYWORD GET behavior
    working with an extended header in a dictionary format do the
    following:

      hdr = readheader(file_name, ext_header_type=list)
      hdr['ext_header'].reverse()
      hdr['ext_header'] = dict(hdr['ext_header'])

    If the data portion of the file is not detached, the file object
    returned has its current read pointer positioned at the first data
    element.  Otherwise, the name of the detached portion of the file
    is returned in the 'detach_name' field.  If the 'detached' aux is
    > 1 and X-Midas is not available to resolve the location of the
    aux, the 'detach_name' will not be present in the returned header.
    The data in the detached file begins at the 'data_start' byte
    offset and is 'data_size' bytes in length.

    Write the given header out to disk.  Returns the full path name to
    the file. If the keepopen parameter is true, an open file handle
    to the file containing the header is also returned. If the data
    portion of the file is in the same file as the header (i.e. it is
    not detached), the open file is returned with the write pointer
    positioned at the first data element in the file.  For detached
    files, you can determine the path to the data file by reading in
    the header with the readheader() method and inspecting the
    'detach_name' field.

    If an 'ext_header' field is present in the header given, the
    extended header is updated on disk.  When this is done for a file
    whose data is not detached, the position of the extended header
    relative to the current values of the 'data_start' + 'data_size'
    fields is also updated and the file is truncated at the end of the
    new extended header. To remove the extended header from a file,
    specify an 'ext_header' field with a value that is an empty string,
    empty list or empty dictionary.

    If there is an extended header present, setting the optional
    <ext_header_type> argument to bluefile.XMTable or
    bluefile.XMKVList (default is list) will cause any Python
    dictionaries, lists, and tuples in the extended header to be
    packed with their structure intact.  See pack_keywords() for more
    details.  Note that if this is the desired behavior,
    <ext_header_type> must be specified each time writeheader() is
    called.  Opening an extended header that had been previously
    packed in this format will not cause it to automatically be packed
    in this format again when it is later written back to disk.  Note
    that there is no difference between specifying bluefile.XMTable or
    bluefile.XMKVList, both are allowed for symmetry with the
    readheader() interface.

    If your write aux is negative, the header will be written to your
    write aux directory, even when writing a header back to disk that
    was read in from an existing file.  Note that this is different
    behavior than X-Midas' headermod command, which modifies a
    header in place and does not consult the aux list.  If your write
    aux is negative and your intention is to write a modified header
    back to an existing file, then you should specify the full path to
    the file in the 'filename' argument.  Specifying the full path
    causes the aux lists to be by-passed, so that a negative write aux
    is inconsequential and the desired behavior is achieved.  This can
    be done by simply passing the modified header's 'file_name' field
    as the 'filename' argument to writeheader:

    Returns the path to the written file as a string.

    Write data to an X-Midas blue type 1000,2000,3000,4000,5000 or
    6000 file.

    <filename> can be either be the name of a file on disk to write
    or create, or a file-like object to which to write out the given
    header and data.  In the case of a file-like object, it must already
    be opened for both read and write access, and the <hdr> argument must
    be provided.  Writing will begin at the current position of the
    file pointer.  Detached files are not supported for file-like objects.

    If the hdr argument (default None) is empty or None the file
    indicated by the filename argument is opened and edited in place.
    If the append argument (default 0) is False, all of the file's
    existing data is replaced with the data given. If the 'ext_header'
    key is present, the file's keywords are also replaced.  If the
    append argument is True, the data given is appended to the end
    of the existing data.  If the append argument is True and the
    optional start argument is not None, the data given will replace
    the existing data, beginning at the (existing data) element
    indicated by start.  Non-integral values of start are rounded to
    the nearest integer.

    If the truncate mode is False, then whatever values are in data
    will be written to that point in the file, overwriting what was
    there, and leaving any data left in the file (if any) afterwards.
    
    If the hdr argument is a non-empty dictionary, a new file will be
    created by the name given in the filename argument.  Thus note that
    the append and truncate arguments are noops in this case.  The header
    dictionary given is expected to contain all of the fields
    representing a BLUE header (e.g. as returned by read() or
    readheader() in this module.)

    If the 'detached' field is non-zero, then the data is written to a
    separate .det file either in the same directory (<0) or in the
    given aux directory.  If X-Midas is not available to resolve the
    path of the aux directory, you must explicitly pass in a header
    with the 'detach_name' full path to the data portion already
    filled in or else an exception is raised.

    Type 1000 data should be an array of data (or a list of tuples if
    the format is vector) of the proper format.

    Type 2000 data should be a list of arrays of data (or lists of
    tuples if the format is vector) with the proper length and
    format.

    Type 3000/5000/6000 data should be a list of dictionaries whose
    keys match the names of the 3000/5000/6000 subrecords lowercased
    without trailing spaces.  Use the format imported by the read()
    method.  If a corresponding key is not found, numeric fields are
    filled with zeros and strings are filled with spaces.

    Type 4000 data should be a list of [(key,value), ...] lists or a
    list of dictionaries if the order of the keys is unimportant.
    Note that if the 4000 file has a fixed record length (the
    'vrecord_length' is > 0) then supplying a data element that packs
    to a size greater than the fixed length will cause an exception to
    be raised.  All elements prior to this element will still be
    written.  All key names are upper-cased when they are written to
    the BLUE file.
    
    ASCII data written to the data portion of the blue file is padded
    out to its expected length with spaces and is truncated if too
    long.  One string should be supplied per atom, i.e. if the data
    type is '4A', you are expected to supply a single string to fill
    32 bytes of data.

    Bit data must be one large string for type 1000, or a list of
    strings for type 2000.  This module only supports writing bit data
    on natural byte (8 bit) boundaries.

    If <hdr> is not None and it contains an extended header, setting
    the optional <ext_header_type> argument to bluefile.XMTable or
    bluefile.XMKVList (default is list) will cause any Python
    dictionaries, lists, and tuples in the extended header to be
    packed with special key,value pairs to maintain their structures
    (embedded lists, dictionaries, etc.).  To retrieve extended header
    keywords with this structure you must specify bluefile.XMKVList or
    bluefile.XMTable specify <ext_header_type> as bluefile.XMKVList or
    bluefile.XMTable when reading them back in.  See the discussion of
    structured vs unstructured keywords in the doc string for
    pack_keywords() for more details.

    Returns a (header, data) tuple for type 1000,2000,3000,4000,5000

    <filename> can be either be the name of a file on disk, or a
    file-like object with the file pointer already positioned to the
    beginning of a bluefile header structure.  Detached files are
    not supported for file-like objects.

    All ASCII data atoms with multiple scalars (e.g. 2A, XA, etc.) are
    treated as single string entities and are returned with trailing
    spaces and nulls removed.

    All arrays of values are returned as NumPy arrays.  Complex
    floats and doubles are supported directly by NumPy.  All other
    complex integer types and all scalars/atom > 2 are expressed by
    shaping the returned NumPy array.
    
    Type 1000 data is returned as a NumPy array as described above.
    ASCII data is returned as a list of strings.

    Type 2000 framed data is returned as a list of NumPy arrays as
    described above, though it is possible to change this behavior with
    the method set_type2000_format().  ASCII framed data is returned as
    a list of lists of strings.

    Type 3000/5000/6000 record oriented data is returned as a list of
    dictionaries with the lower-cased subrecord names as key names.

    Type 4000 (keyword block) data is returned as a list of lists of
    (key,value) pairs with all key names lower-cased.

    If <ext_header_type> is not None (the default), open the extended
    header and return it in the 'ext_header' field of the returned
    header dictionary.  Possible values are list, dict,
    bluefile.XMKVList or bluefile.XMTable.  See the help for
    readheader() for more info.

    Optional 'start' and/or 'end' arguments can be used to return
    a specified portion of the data.  If 'start' and/or 'end' are
    given, elements are read from the filename starting at 'start'
    and going to 'end', using X-Midas file trimming semantics
    (1-based elements, range is inclusive, rounded to nearest
    integer).  'start' defaults to 1, and 'end' defaults to
    hdr['size'].  'start' must be at least 1, and cannot be greater
    than the total number of data elements in the file.  'end' must
    be at least 1, and if it is greater than the number of data
    elements in the file, only the data elements up to the end of
    the file are returned.  Data trimming is not supported for Type
    4000 variable length keyword files.

    If neither 'start' nor 'end' are given, the default behavior is
    to read and return the entire file.

    For type 2000 files, optional 'fstart' and/or 'fend' arguments
    can be used to trim the data within each frame.  If 'fstart'
    and/or 'fend' are given, each frame is trimmed to samples
    fstart:fend (1-based indexing, range is inclusive).  'fstart'
    defaults to 1, and 'fend' defaults to hdr['subsize'].  'fstart'
    must be at least 1, and cannot be greater than the frame size.
    'fend' must be at least 1, and if it is greater than the frame
    size, only the samples up to the end of each frame are returned.

    If neither 'fstart' nor 'fend' are given, the default behavior is
    to read and return the entire frame for each element.

    When 'trimmed' data is returned, the fields in the header returned
    by read() are adjusted to describe the trimmed data, not the
    original data.

    Data is read in blocks of <blocksize> bytes, rounded down to the
    nearest number of elements.  The default size is 16K bytes.  Smaller
    block sizes reduce the memory usage but tend to reduce performance.
    For most applications, block sizes greater than 16K yield minimal
    performance gains while increasing the memory footprint.

    """
    Packs the given keywords into a single string, ready to send to an
    X-Midas extended header.  The keywords arg can be a Python
    dictionary, a list of (key, value) tuples or a raw byte string.
    If it is already a string, it is passed back unmodified.  If the
    ucase arg (default 0) is true then the key names are upper-cased
    when they are packed.

    The endian argument (default '@') is the struct.unpack() format
    character specifying the endianness of the data to be packed
    ('<' == EEEI, '>' == IEEE, '@' == native).

    Warning: All key names are converted to strings before being
    packed and will be unpacked as strings on subsequent calls to
    unpack_ext_header (X-Midas only recognizes string keys).

    If <structured> is false (the default), all lists or tuples are
    converted to NumPy arrays (raising an Exception on failure) then
    packed as an X-Midas atomic result (i.e. a single key-value pair
    whose value is an array of like-typed numbers).  Python ints and
    floats are converted to 'L' and 'D' types respectively.  All other
    object types (including dictionaries and complex()) are converted
    to strings and stored as ASCII values (and will be returned as
    strings when the block is unpacked later).

    If <structured> is true, all values that are Python dicts, lists
    or tuples are packed with extra tag-value pairs to maintain their
    structure and each value within them is then packed individually
    using the same algorithm (recursively).  If you want to pack an
    atomic array of numeric elements as a single tag-value pair, the
    value must be a NumPy or array module array.  Complex values are
    packed as a 2 element NumPy array, and when extracted are
    returned as such; X-Midas keyword format currently has no way of
    differentiating between a complex value and an atomic array of 2
    numeric values.

    If these packed keywords are then unpacked by calling
    unpack_keywords(..., structured=1), the returned keywords will
    contain any embedded dicts, lists, tuples as Python dicts and
    lists.  This packed structured format is also understood by the
    XMValue C++ class (note that currently, converting a section with
    repeated key names to a dictionary is not allowed by the XMValue
    class).

    Note that these *structured* packed keywords are in legal X-Midas
    keyword format (completely backwards compatible) with additional
    tag-value pairs to describe their structure.  These keywords can
    still be read by all regular X-Midas keyword utilities.  You can
    therefore unpack them into the classic X-Midas key-value pair list
    format which will contain these extra structure tags.  The order
    of these tags in the list is important.  Converting this
    non-structured list to a dictionary and then packing it again will
    cause the order of these extra tags to change and therefore cause
    any future attempt at correctly unpacking them with structured
    format impossible.

    readheader(...).  Although readheader can return the extended
    header keywords in different formats, this function requires the
    *list* format (other formats don't necessarily preserve ordering).

    <scope_list> is a list of "key=value" strings defining the scope
    of interest.

    1) The following keyword list groups keywords according to time:
    
        TIME==12:00
	FREQ==31e6
	AMPL==1.1
	TIME==13:00
	FREQ==32e6

    2) Keyword scope can be nested by adding additional elements to
    the <scope_list> argument.  Take the keyword segment (indented for
    clarity):

        TIME==13:00
	  RCVR==01
	    CHAN==A

	      AMPL==3.4
	  RCVR==02
