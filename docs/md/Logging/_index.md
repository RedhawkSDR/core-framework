# Logging

REDHAWK provides a logging capability for use by all resources <abbr title="See Glossary.">components</abbr>, <abbr title="See Glossary.">devices</abbr>, and <abbr title="See Glossary.">services</abbr>. By default, the REDHAWK Framework and its support libraries have been developed to take advantage of the underlying language's implementation: log4cxx, log4j, and log4py for C++, Java, and Python, respectively. All three libraries follow the basic premise of the log4j capabilities. A root logger definition is the parent of all loggers and configuration of the loggers is controlled through a Java style properties file. Each REDHAWK resource creates a named logger as a child of the root logger. (The name is based on the underlying resource's name.) This chapter explains how to configure and use the logging capability. For a detailed description of log4j and its capabilities, refer to the log4j website (<http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/>).

All REDHAWK-generated code for resources provides an instantiation of a logging object for use by the resource. For Java and Python implementations, the underlying logging implementation of the language is used. For C++, there is a set of macro definitions that enable a resource to use the underlying logging implementation associated with the REDHAWK Core Framework (CF) library.
