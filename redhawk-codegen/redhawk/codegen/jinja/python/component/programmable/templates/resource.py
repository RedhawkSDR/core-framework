        This is called by the framework immediately after your ${artifactType} registers with the NameService.
        
        In general, you should add customization here and not in the __init__ constructor.  If you have 
        a custom port implementation you can override the specific implementation here with a statement
        similar to the following:

        This is called automatically after allocateCapacity or deallocateCapacity are called.

           self._usageState = CF.Device.IDLE   # not in use
           self._usageState = CF.Device.ACTIVE # in use, with capacity remaining for allocation

        Basic functionality:
        
            The process method should process a single "chunk" of data and then return. This method
            will be called from the processing thread again, and again, and again until it returns
            FINISH or stop() is called on the ${artifactType}.  If no work is performed, then return NOOP.
            
        StreamSRI:
            To create a StreamSRI object, use the following code (this generates a normalized SRI that does not flush the queue when full):
                self.sri = bulkio.sri.create(self.stream_id)

        PrecisionUTCTime:
            To create a PrecisionUTCTime object, use the following code:
                tstamp = bulkio.timestamp.now() 
  
        Ports:

            Each port instance is accessed through members of the following form: self.port_<PORT NAME>
            
            Data is obtained in the process function through the getPacket call (BULKIO only) on a
            provides port member instance. The getPacket function call is non-blocking - if no data
            is available, it will return immediately with all values == None.
            
            To send data, call the appropriate function in the port directly. In the case of BULKIO,
            convenience functions have been added in the port classes that aid in output.
            
            Interactions with non-BULKIO ports are left up to the ${artifactType} developer's discretion.
            
        Properties:
        
            Properties are accessed directly as member variables. If the property name is baudRate,
            then accessing it (for reading or writing) is achieved in the following way: self.baudRate.
            

        Logging:

            The member _baseLog is a logger whose base name is the component (or device) instance name.
            New logs should be created based on this logger name.

            To create a new logger,
                my_logger = self._baseLog.getChildLogger("foo")

            Assuming component instance name abc_1, my_logger will then be created with the 
            name "abc_1.user.foo".

        Example:
        
            # This example assumes that the ${artifactType} has two ports:
            #   - A provides (input) port of type bulkio.InShortPort called dataShort_in
            #   - A uses (output) port of type bulkio.OutFloatPort called dataFloat_out
            # The mapping between the port and the class if found in the ${artifactType}
            # base class.
            # This example also makes use of the following Properties:
            #   - A float value called amplitude
            #   - A boolean called increaseAmplitude
            
            data, T, EOS, streamID, sri, sriChanged, inputQueueFlushed = self.port_dataShort_in.getPacket()
            
            if data == None:
                return NOOP
                
            outData = range(len(data))
            for i in range(len(data)):
                if self.increaseAmplitude:
                    outData[i] = float(data[i]) * self.amplitude
                else:
                    outData[i] = float(data[i])
                
            # NOTE: You must make at least one valid pushSRI call
            if sriChanged:
                self.port_dataFloat_out.pushSRI(sri);

            self.port_dataFloat_out.pushPacket(outData, T, EOS, streamID)
            return NORMAL
            
        """
